about: cube surfer game replica for my com4533 mobile game development course. 

unity version: 2020.3.40f1

how to play: 
  unity editor: move your mouse to move character. mouse-left-click to drop cube(s). avoid walls and collect cubes.
  mobile: swipe left/right to move character. swipe down to drop cube(s).


IMPORTANT: desired speed of player (see SCR_player component of Player object) is 35f for mobile build.
           please use 15 for unity editor (because same speed differs from editor to mobile)

third commit updates: 
  use of rigidbody gravity instead coding
  change of color for platform
  walls are thicker
